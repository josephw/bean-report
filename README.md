## `bean-report`

A fork of (a subset of) `bean-report`, removed from [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount)
in [this commit](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/commit/a7c4f14f083de63e8d4e5a8d3664209daf95e1ec).

As the commit message says:
> Use bean-query instead (or Fava).

If you ignore that advice, this fork includes `balances`, `cash`, `holdings`, and `networth`, as lightweight command-line
reports on the state of a Beancount ledger.
